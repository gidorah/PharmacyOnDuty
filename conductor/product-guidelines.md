# Product Guidelines - Eczanerede

## Tone and Voice
- **Empathetic & Direct:** Communications should be concise and helpful. Users are often looking for medication in urgent or stressful situations. Avoid unnecessary jargon and provide clear, reassuring instructions.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on the "next step" (e.g., "Get Directions", "Call Pharmacy").

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Mobile-First Utility:** The interface must be optimized for one-handed operation on mobile devices. Use large touch targets, intuitive gestures (like swiping), and prioritize the most critical information (distance and status).
- **High Contrast Status:** Use distinct, high-contrast colors to differentiate between "Open" and "On-Duty" pharmacies. This ensures that users can scan the list or map and instantly understand availability.
- **Clean & Modern Aesthetic:** Leverage Tailwind CSS for a consistent, professional design. Maintain plenty of whitespace to reduce cognitive load and keep the focus on the content.
- **Gesture-Based Navigation:** Utilize Hammer.js for smooth, native-feeling interactions such as swiping through the pharmacy list or expanding the bottom sheet.

## Design Principles
1. **Speed to Value:** Every design choice should help the user find a pharmacy faster.
2. **Contextual Clarity:** Provide all necessary context (distance, phone, address, directions) in a single, compact view.
3. **Reliability First:** Design UI elements that clearly communicate the freshness of the data (e.g., "Last updated 5 minutes ago").
