### Key Components and Workflow

1.  **Data Collection (Scraping and APIs):**

    *   **Web Scrapers:** The `pharmacies/utils` directory contains custom web scrapers (`ankaraeo_scraper.py`, `eskisehireo_scraper.py`, `istanbul_saglik_scraper.py`) that extract pharmacy data from the respective city pharmacy chamber websites. These scrapers are designed to handle the specific HTML structure of each website. Data is scraped on-demand when the data in the database is considered "old." The scrapers are run asynchronously using Celery to improve performance and overcome potential geoblocking issues.
    *   **Google Places API:** The `pharmacy_fetch.py` module utilizes the Google Places API's Nearby Search to find pharmacies near the user's location. This is used primarily when pharmacies are "open" (during regular business hours). Results are cached using `@lru_cache`.
    *   **Google Maps Geocoding API:** Used in `get_city_name_from_location` (within `utils.py`) to determine the user's city based on their latitude and longitude. This helps determine which city's on-duty pharmacy data to retrieve. Results are cached.
    *   **Google Maps Distance Matrix API:** Used to efficiently calculate travel distances and durations between the user's location and multiple pharmacies. This information is used to sort the pharmacy list by proximity. Results are cached.

2.  **Asynchronous Task Processing (Celery):**

    * Celery is used to run the web scrapers asynchronously. This improves the responsiveness of the web application and allows for offloading long-running scraping tasks to a separate worker process.
    * Redis is used as the message broker for Celery, facilitating communication between the Django application and the Celery workers.
    * The `pharmacies/tasks.py` file defines the Celery tasks, including the `run_scraper` task, which takes a city name as input and executes the corresponding scraper.
    *    Celery Beat is used for scheduling periodic tasks. The schedule is stored in the database using `django-celery-beat`.

3.  **Spatial Database (PostGIS):**

    *   **Data Models:** The `pharmacies/models.py` file defines three core models:
        *   `City`: Represents a city (e.g., "eskisehir," "istanbul," "ankara"). Stores the city name and the timestamp of the last successful data scrape. Includes methods to check pharmacy status and retrieve on-duty pharmacies.
        *   `WorkingSchedule`: Defines the regular opening and closing times for pharmacies in a specific city (weekday and Saturday hours). Has a one-to-one relationship with the `City` model. Includes methods to check if pharmacies are currently open.
        *   `Pharmacy`: Stores information about individual pharmacies, including name, location (as a PostGIS `PointField`), address, contact details, and duty start/end times (when applicable). Has a foreign key relationship with the `City` model.
    *   **Geospatial Queries:** GeoDjango and PostGIS enable efficient spatial queries, such as finding pharmacies within a certain radius of the user's location and ordering them by distance.

4.  **API Layer (Django Views):**

    *   **`get_pharmacy_points` (POST):** This is the primary API endpoint. It accepts the user's latitude and longitude as input.
        *   Determines the user's city using `get_city_name_from_location`.
        *   Checks the `City` model's `last_scraped_at` field to see if the on-duty pharmacy data needs to be refreshed (scraped again).
        *   If the data is old or the city is in "open" status, fetches updated data and updates/creates records in the database.
        *   Queries the database for the nearest on-duty pharmacies (if applicable) or uses the Google Places API to find open pharmacies.
        *   Calculates travel distances using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API.
        *   Returns a JSON response containing a list of pharmacy data, including location, name, address, status, and travel distance.
    *   **`google_maps_proxy` (GET):** A proxy endpoint for the Google Maps JavaScript API. This is used to avoid exposing the API key directly in the client-side code and to implement caching. It checks the `Referer` header to prevent unauthorized use.

5.  **Frontend Interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**

    *   **Interactive Map:** The Google Maps JavaScript API is used to display an interactive map centered on the user's location. Markers are added for the user's location and the nearest pharmacies.
    *   **Pharmacy List:** The list of pharmacies is dynamically generated using JavaScript based on the API response. Each pharmacy item displays relevant information and includes a button to get directions.
    *   **Swipeable Bottom Sheet:** The pharmacy list is presented in a bottom sheet that can be expanded or collapsed by clicking or swiping (using Hammer.js).
    *   **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS is used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

6.  **Infrastructure:**

    *   **Docker and Docker Compose:** The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run consistently across different environments. Docker Compose is used to define and manage the multi-container setup (Django, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and potentially OSRM – though OSRM is currently commented out).
    *   **Heroku:** The production environment is hosted on Heroku. The `Procfile` specifies the commands to run the web server (Gunicorn) and perform database migrations.
    *   **WhiteNoise:** Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are served efficiently using WhiteNoise.
    *   **Sentry:** Sentry is integrated for error tracking and monitoring.

## Setup and Installation


### Prerequisites

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Python 3.13:** The required Python version.
*   **uv:** Modern Python package installer and environment manager ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).
*   **Docker (and Docker Compose):** For running the application in containers (recommended).
*   **A Google Maps API Key:** Required for using the Google Maps services.
*   **A Sentry DSN (Optional):** Required for using Sentry.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pharmacyonduty.git  # Replace with your repository URL
    cd pharmacyonduty
    ```

2.  **Install uv (if not already installed):**

    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # On Windows
    powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    This will create a virtual environment in `.venv` and install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

4.  **Set Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (or set these variables directly in your environment, for example in `docker-compose.yml` for Docker-based setups). See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.  Make sure to set `REDIS_PASSWORD` to a secure password.

5. **Database Setup:**

    *   **Without Docker:**
        *   Make sure you have PostgreSQL and PostGIS installed and running.
        *   Create a database and user with the credentials specified in your `.env` file.
        *   Enable the PostGIS extension on the database: `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`
    *   **With Docker (Recommended):**
        *   Docker Compose will handle the database setup automatically.

6.  **Apply Database Migrations:**

    ```bash
    uv run python manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  **Create a Superuser (Optional):**

    ```bash
    uv run python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8.  **Add Cities and Working Schedules:**

    You'll need to populate the `City` and `WorkingSchedule` models with data for the supported cities. You can do this via the Django admin interface (after creating a superuser) or by using a custom management command (like the provided `create_working_schedule.py` example, which you'd need to adapt/extend for other cities). For example, to use `create_working_schedule.py`, run:

    ```bash
    uv run python manage.py create_working_schedule
    ```

9. **Run the Development Server:**

    *   **Without Docker:**

        ```bash
        uv run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
        ```

    *   **With Docker Compose (Recommended):**

        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
      This command builds the Docker images (if necessary) and starts the containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

    For production, use `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

    ```bash
    # On the main server (runs all services except the Celery worker)
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d --no-deps django db nginx redis certbot beat

    # On the worker server (runs only the Celery worker)
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d --no-deps worker
    ```
> Note: Before running these commands, ensure that the necessary environment variables are set, especially `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` for the worker, and that the dockerfiles (`dockerfile.prod` and `Dockerfile.scraper`) are correctly configured.

    In both cases, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. With Docker, the database will be accessible at `http://localhost:5432`, and debugpy will be accessible at `http://localhost:5678`.

### Remote Development Setup (docker-compose.remotedev.yml)

For remote development and debugging within Docker containers, use the `docker-compose.remotedev.yml` file. This configuration includes settings for remote debugging with `debugpy`.

1.  **Generate SSL Certificates:**

    Run this command on your host machine (not inside a container) to generate self-signed SSL certificates for local HTTPS development. This is necessary because the application uses HTTPS, and the browser will not allow insecure connections to localhost. Your own server IP address should be specified in command!

    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
      -keyout private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
      -out certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt \
      -subj "/CN=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
    ```

2.  **Create `remotedev_nginx.conf`:**

    Create a file named `remotedev_nginx.conf` in the project root directory using the `remotedev_nginx.conf.template` as a template:

    ```
    cp remotedev_nginx.conf.template remotedev_nginx.conf
    ```
    
    Open `remotedev_nginx.conf` and replace `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` with your server's public IP address in both `server_name` directives.

3.  **Run with Remote Development Compose File:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.remotedev.yml up --build
    ```

This will start the application with the remote debugging configuration. You can then attach a debugger (like VS Code's debugger) to the running container on port 5678.

## Production Deployment (HTTPS with Docker, Nginx, and Let’s Encrypt)

This section explains how to run the application in a production setting using docker-compose.prod.yml. It also covers configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy and obtaining an SSL certificate with Certbot for eczanerede.com.

1.  **Prerequisites**

    -   **Domain Name:** You must own a domain (e.g., eczanerede.com) pointing to the IP of your server.
    -   **DNS Config:** An A-record or CNAME pointing eczanerede.com and (optionally) www.eczanerede.com to your server’s public IP.
    -   **Ports:** Make sure ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are open on your server/firewall.
    -   **Docker + Docker Compose:** installed on your server.

2.  **Ensure Your docker-compose.prod.yml Is Set for Production**

    A sample docker-compose.prod.yml might contain services for:

    -   django (running Gunicorn on port 8000 internally),
    -   db (PostgreSQL with PostGIS),
    -   nginx (serving on ports 80 and 443),
    -   certbot (for Let’s Encrypt).

    Example snippet (abridged):

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      django:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: dockerfile.prod
        depends_on:
          - db
        environment:
          - DB_HOST=db
          - DJANGO_DEBUG=False
        command: >
          sh -c "uv run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput &&
                 uv run gunicorn PharmacyOnDuty.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000"

      db:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile.postgis
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
          POSTGRES_DB: gis

      nginx:
        image: nginx:alpine
        depends_on:
          - django
        # Expose both HTTP and HTTPS
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
        # Mount config and cert volumes
        volumes:
          - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
          - ./certbot_webroot:/var/www/certbot
          - ./certbot_letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:ro

      certbot:
        image: certbot/certbot
        volumes:
          - ./certbot_webroot:/var/www/certbot
          - ./certbot_letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
        # No entrypoint here until we do the initial issuance
        # entrypoint: ...
    ```

3.  **Create & Mount the Folders for Certbot**

    On your server (in the project directory):

    ```bash
    mkdir -p certbot_webroot certbot_letsencrypt
    ```

    -   `certbot_webroot` is where Let’s Encrypt’s HTTP-01 challenge files go.
    -   `certbot_letsencrypt` is where your certificates (fullchain + privkey) will be stored.

4.  **Minimal nginx.conf for Production**

    Below is a sample nginx.conf you could commit to version control. It serves two server blocks: one for HTTP (port 80) to allow ACME challenges and redirect to HTTPS, and one for HTTPS on port 443.

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name eczanerede.com www.eczanerede.com;

        # Serve Let’s Encrypt ACME challenges from /var/www/certbot
        location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
            root /var/www/certbot;
        }

        # (Optional) Redirect everything else on port 80 to HTTPS
        location / {
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name eczanerede.com www.eczanerede.com;

        # These will be populated by Certbot
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/eczanerede.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/eczanerede.com/privkey.pem;

        # Basic security headers (optional)
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
        add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
        add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
        add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

        # Proxy requests to Django
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://django:8000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }

        # Serve ACME challenges on port 443 as well (not strictly required)
        location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
            root /var/www/certbot;
        }
    }
    ```

5.  **Build and Start Containers (HTTP-Only First)**

    Before obtaining a certificate, comment out the HTTPS parts or keep them but point to a dummy certificate. For instance, just remove `listen 443 ssl;` lines until you fetch real certs:

    1.  ```bash
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
        ```
    2.  Check logs:

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs -f
        ```

        Make sure django, db, and nginx all start without errors.

    At this point, you should be able to reach `http://eczanerede.com` (port 80). If that works, proceed.

6.  **Obtain the Let’s Encrypt Certificate**

    1.  Stop any looping certbot container if it’s in your file:

        ```bash
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop certbot
        ```

    2.  Run a one-time issuance:

        ```bash
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm certbot \
          certonly \
          --webroot \
          --webroot-path /var/www/certbot \
          -d eczanerede.com -d www.eczanerede.com \
          --email <YOUR_EMAIL> \
          --agree-tos \
          --no-eff-email \
          -v
        ```

        If it succeeds, you’ll see “Successfully received certificate” and the cert files appear in `./certbot_letsencrypt/live/eczanerede.com/`.

7.  **Re-Enable HTTPS in Nginx**

    Now that you have real certificate files, uncomment or update your `nginx.conf` lines for SSL:

    ```
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name eczanerede.com www.eczanerede.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/eczanerede.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/eczanerede.com/privkey.pem;

        ...
    }
    ```

    Expose port 443 in `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

    ```
    nginx:
      ports:
        - "80:80"
        - "443:443"
    ```

    Then redeploy:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
    ```

    Visit `https://eczanerede.com`—you should now have a valid SSL certificate.

8.  **(Optional) Automatic Certificate Renewal**

    To keep your certificate from expiring, add back a looping entrypoint for Certbot:

    ```yaml
    certbot:
      image: certbot/certbot
      volumes:
        - ./certbot_webroot:/var/www/certbot
        - ./certbot_letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
      entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d certbot
    ```

    This container will periodically run `certbot renew`, and as long as port 80 is still accessible and Nginx is configured to serve `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`, renewals will happen automatically.

    That’s it! Your application is now served securely via HTTPS at eczanerede.com.
